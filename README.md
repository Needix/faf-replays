# Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever Replay Analyzer

A web app for analyzing replays from the game Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever.

# Getting started

Check out this repo and the [backend](https://github.com/Needix/faf-replay-rest-api) repo. Requesting replays from the
frontend automatically downloads and analyzes the replays from the FAF servers. The backend may be used to download
replays in bulk. A database is needed for the backend for storing the analyzed replays.
